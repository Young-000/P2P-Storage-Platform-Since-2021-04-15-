Dear Editor-in-Chief,

We would like to thank Production and Operations Management journal for handling our paper, Sharing Economy in the Cloud: Pricing Schemes for Peer-to-Peer Storage Platforms (POM-Jul-20-SI-0934.R4), which was originally submitted on July 20 of 2020. Unfortunately, our paper got rejection after spending three years for undergoing five rounds of reviews with four different version of revisions. Since we believe that this lengthy review process was neither efficient nor fair, and we wish to respectfully appeal.

Review history
Initial Submitted: 31-Jul-2020\\
1st round(Major revision): 25-Oct-2020\\
2nd round(Major revision): 15-Oct-2021\\
3rd round(\textbf{Minor revision}): 14-Jun-2022\\
4th round(Major revision): 01-Dec-2022\\
5th round(Reject): 04-Jul-2023\\


As you see the history, our paper just has gone through normal review process until the 3rd round; we initially got major revision decision for first and second round and got minor revision decision on the third round. In each round, the review team gave us detailed and constructive comments and SE proposed a clear path to the publication of this paper. 

However, in the fourth round, which we wish to be the last round for acceptance of the paper, we are told that one of the original reviewers is not available for review and a new fresh reviewer comes in. The new reviewer raised new issues that seem to be already resolved among original review team and was negative about publication of this paper. Please note that one of the original reviewers who was available for review recommended acceptance of our paper without furth condition in the fourth-round review. However, SE, who has been supportive to suggest a path to publication, suddenly changed his position and told us that the fifth round is the last chance to persuade the negative reviewer. 

In the fifth-round review with R4 version of the paper, we did our best to deliver such a point by clearly summarizing how each issue is handled reasonably so far. Nevertheless, the new reviewer remains negative and complains that our paper has not been adequately positioned in the literature, which has never been raised up to third rounds of reviews. 

In this course, we believe that our addresses and revisions to review team’s comments through three rounds of review has not been incorporated reasonably by the new reviewer. Although we fully understand that sometimes a reviewer may become unavailable for various reasons, we believe that the way our paper is treated during the review process in the fourth and fifth rounds was not efficient nor fair, and with all the respect, we wish to be re-evaluated objectively based on our history of all review processes.
Thank you for your consideration.


Sincerely,
Kun Soo Park

아래 내용은 그간 히스토리 및 fourth/fifth round에 받은 내용들이 어떠한 이유로 unfair하다고 여겨졌는지에 대한 요약 내용임.\\



1.  SE는 3rd round까지의 리뷰팀의 방향을 긍정적으로 보았고, model / implication 등의 크리티컬한 이슈가 없이  몇 가지의 writing / exposition 등의 마이너한 부분만 개선하면 된다는 취지로 accept에 가까운 minor revision을 주었음.

\begin{quotation}
SE's 3rd review:\\
{\em
I sent this revised paper to the same two reviewers. The reviewers saw the good progress made in the revision and appreciated the effort that the authors exerted. However, their recommendations split. One reviewer recommended a minor revision, and the other recommended rejection. I carefully read the paper and the revision note, and I also saw the paper has improved from the previous version. \textcolor{blue}{Further, I feel that the authors should be able to address the remaining comments with reasonable effort. Therefore, I would recommend a minor revision.} 

\textcolor{blue}{The remaining issues center on the writing and exposition.} R2 provides a list of valuable and detailed suggestions on how to improve the paper along this line. I would encourage the authors to carefully consider these suggestions. If the authors decide not to incorporate some of these suggestions, please provide detailed and convincing explanation in the response document. 

R1 is concerned about the model setup and complains about the unclear presentations. In fact, echoing the reviewers, I also find some of the description is unclear or even confusing. One critical issue raised by R1 is how $n_r$ and $n_p$ are determined by $p_s$ and $p_b$. The same as the other reviewer, I guess $n_r$ and $n_p$ are just two exogenously given parameters. \textcolor{blue}{If this is true, R1 might have misunderstood the setup because of the confusing presentations. I would encourage the authors to think carefully about these model components and clearly state them in the paper.} Another critical issue raised by R1 is about the renters’ utility functions. \textcolor{blue}{The authors should provide more justifications or explanation as well.}

To avoid a prolonged review process, I would encourage the authors to give these comments a serious thought and endeavor to successfully address these remaining issues in next round. }
\end{quotation}\vspace{-4mm}

2. minor revision까지의 핵심이었던 Reviewer 2는 모든 내용이 address 되었다고 판단, minor revision 이후 fourth round에서 accept을 주었음. 리뷰과정에서 reviewer 2는 introduction에서부터 시작해서 literature review, 모델 등까지 전반적인 부분에서 세세한 피드백을 주었고, 우리는 이를 address하기 위해 최선을 다했음. \\
(여기에 추가해서 reviewer 1의 review도 충분히 address했다고 자신함 -- 이 추가되면 좋을 것 같네요!)
\begin{quotation}
Reviewer 1(maybe 2)의 4th review:\\
{\em
Reviewer: 1 \\
\textcolor{blue}{Accept.}}
\end{quotation}

3. minor revision에서 기존 리뷰팀 중 rejection을 준 리뷰어의 응답이 없어 SE가 새로운 리뷰어를 데리고오고, 새 리뷰어는 기존의 리뷰 과정과 상충되는 혹은 새로운 부분에 대해서 리뷰를 남김. 이때 SE는 오직 R3의 의견에 따라 지난 라운드에서 본인이 제시한 내용과 전혀 다른 새로운 부분에 집중했을 뿐더러, 그 중에서는 기존 리뷰 과정에서 합의하고 넘어간 부분과 상충되는 부분도 있었음. 그럼에도 불구하고 우리의 지난 revision이 실망스럽다고 주장하며 major revision을 줌\\

\begin{quotation}
SE의 4th review:\\
{\em
This is an R3 paper. On one hand, the authors' efforts are well-appreciated. \textcolor{blue}{On the other hand, the paper seems to be still not yet publishable. It is disappointing.} 

\textcolor{blue}{It happens that one critical reviewer who voted for rejection last time is not available.} As a result, a new reviewer is invited to help. The comments are not positive. While I feel it is fair for the authors to have one last chance to improve the work faithfully. If they choose to do so, please work really hard to improve the paper as much as possible for the highest standard. Next round, we will make a decision on either accept or reject. 

In addition to addressing the review comments, please pay attention to the following: 

\textcolor{blue}{[Point 1] We need a complete picture of the study. What are the key insights? What is the core conclusion. They should be clearly presented in a coherent way. We need a beautiful picture and a perfect paper. }

\textcolor{blue}{[Point 2]Implications to practices: What is the big deal of the findings? What real world practices can be improved with respect to the theoretical findings? Some real-name companies' practices should be explained/challenged by using the derived findings in the paper. This demonstrates the applications of the findings from this piece of research.}

\textcolor{blue}{[Point 3]Contribution to literature: More discussions on how the findings supplement or challenge the prior studies in the OM literature should be explained. As the new reviewer points out, many important works are missing in the literature review and the current paper's novelty is under doubt. This will better highlight the paper's positioning in the OM literature. }

\textcolor{blue}{[Point 4]Model: Please explain the physical meaning of different model settings clearly. This is in line with the reviewer's comments on the "invest in no redundancy" case.}}
\end{quotation}

[Point 1\&2]\\
이미 2nd review에서 R2가 two motivation examples를 가지고 있고, 충분히 흥미로운 인사이트라고 제시. SE는 2nd review에서는 articulate the contribution beyond the existing literature라는 review를 남겼으나, 3rd에서는 이와 관련된 리뷰가 존재하지 않는 것으로 보아 이미 암묵적으로 implication에 대해서는 confirm이 되고 넘어갔다고 볼 수 있음.\\
\begin{quotation}
    SE's 2nd review:\\
    \em{I sent the revised paper to the same review team. While they acknowledge and appreciate the effort exerted by the authors, both reviewers continue to have major concerns with the paper. As a result, both reviewers suggest another round of "major revision." I went over the revised paper and the reviewers' comments, and I concur with the reviewers’ comments. I would like to recommend another "major revision" and give the authors the opportunity to address the concerns. \\
    Given the reviewers’ expertise and the thorough reports they provide, I have little to add. Rather, I would refer the authors to the detailed comments in the reviewers’ reports. Next, I would like to highlight three major concerns.     \\
    Main Concern: Uniqueness of Storage Sharing\\
    As R2 correctly notes, it remains unclear in this revised version what are the unique features of storage sharing (compared with other peer-to-peer platforms) and whether these unique features are captured by the main model. If this study is positioned to focus on storage sharing, the authors may want to elaborate on its distinct features, ensure the model captures some (if not all) of these features, and explain how these distinct features connect with the main results. Of course, the alternative is to position the paper to study peer-to-peer platforms in general. In that case, it will be fine to assume away some specifics of a particular type of platforms. \textcolor{blue}{In either way, the authors should be upfront and present clearly about that to readers, and articulate the contribution beyond the existing literature.} \\
    Main Concern: Model\\
    Both reviewers continue to have concerns with the model setup. 
(a) Heterogeneity of users: As R2 points out, users (both renters and providers) can be heterogeneous in other dimensions as well, which is a good observation. The authors are encouraged to explore possible models which consider heterogeneity in multiple dimensions. However, I would think that the review team will also be fine if the authors can only incorporate some heterogeneity into the model (e.g., the heterogeneity the current model considers). If they take this approach, the authors should elaborate on at least the following two aspects---why the authors consider this specific heterogeneity against other possible heterogeneity, and how the chosen model setup (i.e., ignoring the other possible heterogeneity) affects the main insights.\\
 (b) Information: R2 raises a question about how an individual provider could learn the information about the expected demand, which requires some clarification. If there is no specific mechanism or channel for providers to learn this information, I wonder if their “rational expectation” works. At any rate, the authors should carefully think about this and clearly explain how providers know the expected demand.\\
 (c) Probability of Service Failure: R1 correctly notes that is it is not rigorous to claim that “by setting a proper $m$ and $k$, the chance of service failure is very small,” because price is endogenous and it affects the number of active providers. The authors should at least examine whether the desirable $m$ and $k$ will occur in equilibrium (under the equilibrium price).\\
 Main Concern: Writing\\
 I agree with R2 that the writing could be further improved. The reviewer generously provides detailed suggestions. I would encourage the authors to follow the suggestions and go even beyond to further polish the paper.  I am very thankful to the two experienced reviewers for providing their valuable comments. I hope the authors can take advantage of their comments and further improve the paper. The authors did a good job clarifying many issues in the first round. I would encourage the authors to address the reviewers’ comments with the same standard. Good luck with the revision.}

[Point 3] 
2nd review에서 R2에게 literature review에 대한 상세 review를 받음. 그리고 이를 바탕을 모든 streamline을 재구성하고 contribution도 재정의. 그리고 이와 관련된 내용은 SE향의 response에도 첨부.\\
이후 3rd review에서 이와 관련된 내용이 하나도 없었으므로 이 부분도 confirm이 이미 된 부분으로 판단
\begin{quotation}
Part of R2' 2nd review:\\
    \em{
    The literature review needs to be streamlined. For example, on top of page 7, the discussion is about “this study also extends the literature on sharing platforms for computing resources,” then, on the same page, the discussion continues to be about “emerging platforms have enabled sharing various computing resources.” But, later on page 8, again the discussion goes back to "this study also contributes to the literature on the pricing for resource sharing services." The writing of these paragraphs feels like on an ad hoc basis. Maybe a better sequence is as follows: (1) pricing (and capacity management) in centralized public cloud; (2) P2P sharing of computing resources; (3) literature on other forms of sharing economies. Finally, in the last paragraph, summarize the distinct model features and contribution to the existing literature.
    }
\end{quotation}

\begin{quotation}
Part of the response on 3rd review for SE:\\
\em{
    Regarding the literature review, we have followed Reviewer 2's comments in \textbf{Point B2}. We have reorganized the literature review section and provided a separate section on our contributions to the literature. Combining with our efforts to clarify the uniqueness of storage sharing, we could better streamline the literature and emphasize our originality.}
\end{quotation}

[Point 4]
1. 전반적인 모델 세팅의 차이에 대해서는 2nd review에서 'Uniqueness of Storage Sharing'에 대한 답변을 진행하며 해소가 되었다고 판단.\\
2. invest in no redundancy case의 경우에는 기존 SE의 2nd review에 나왔던 'Probaility of Service Failure'와 간접적으로 연결이 되어있는 부분이고, 이 부분 또한 해소가 되었다고 판단.\\


즉, 4rd review에 받은 SE가 지적한 4개의 포인트는 1) 3rd review에 받았던 point인 writting / exposition /  ore justifications or  explanation as well과 결이 다를 뿐 아니라 2) 기존 2nd review에서 response를 하고 3rd review에서 언급이 없어 간접적으로 confirm이 되었다고 판단한 부분들을 모두 뒤흔드는 요소의 review\\

4. 이에 대한 부분을 clear하게 가고자 5th response를 진행하며 우리가 이제까지 해온 방향 및 어떤 방향으로 우리가 개선해왔고, 어떤 부분이 기존의 내용들과 상충되는지 등 상세 내역을 정리해서 공유\\

    R2's 2nd review:\\
    \em{
        In this revised manuscript, the most notable changes, as compared to the previous manuscript, are as follows. (1) The contribution of this paper is re-positioned as investigation of the impacts of different pricing schemes (subscription-based, two-part tariff, and hybrid). (2) The objective of the platform is changed to maximize its expected profit, and the impacts of the platform’s optimal pricing decisions on the total social surplus are examined. (3) Heterogeneity (renters’ willingnessto-pay and providers’ operating costs) is incorporated. (4) The motivation examples are enhanced. As can be seen, the authors have put substantial efforts to address the review team’s concerns raised in the last round, and, as a result, this paper has been completely revamped. I would like to thank them for their sincere efforts. \textcolor{blue}{On the positive side, I think the introduction section has been tightened with better explanations for the two motivation examples. Moreover, the potential contribution of this paper is clearer with the focus on comparing the impacts of the three common pricing schemes. Last, I think the results about the ranking of the performance of those pricing schemes based on different performance measure (platform’s profit vs total social surplus) and different supply-demand conditions (sufficient vs insufficient supply) are interesting. Since the paper has been improved in those areas mentioned above, it has good potential to get published.} Having said that, I feel that there are some significant questions or concerns about the revised model and there is still plenty of room for improvement in the writing. Hence, I think the paper still needs to be strengthened and polished. My recommendation is Major Revision, hoping that the authors would clear those concerns in a satisfactory fashion (as they did in the last round) such that we can see a clearer path for acceptance.

5. 하지만 5th review에서 SE는 contribution이 still below하다는 부분을 literature positioning -- 3rd review때 해소 -- 및 various model setting -- 3rd review때 해소--를 근거로 들며 reject을 판단.\\
또한 이 과정에서 이미 accept을 준 기존 reviewer의 의견들과 기존 review stream은 전혀 고려가 되지 않은 상황에서 오직 신규 reviewer인 R3만의 의견이 반영된 채로 리뷰 프로세스 및 판단이 진행됌.

    This is an R4 paper. As we indicated in the last round comments, this will be the last revision chance. We will have to decide whether to accept (or conditionally accept) or reject the paper in this round. 
    We are grateful for the reviewers who commented on this paper last time to help this time. To my deep regrets, despite seeing some improvement, the critical reviewer who had serious concerns last time still found serious problems in this R4 paper. 
    \textcolor{blue}{Overall, the reviewer advised that the paper's contribution is still below the needed level for POM and there are problems in areas such as literature positioning (which relates to the novelty of findings) as well as various model settings and considerations.} The reviewer hence advised against publication. As the comments are very detailed in the review report, I do not repeat them here. 
    Based on the review comments which I concur, I am afraid the paper should be returned. I do sincerely thank the authors for their hard work and kind submission.

6. 이미 3년에 걸친 기간에 기존 reviewer과의 세 차례의 리뷰 라운드를 통하여 3rd round에 minor revision을 받았던 논문이 이와 같이 4th round부터 오직 '신규 reviewer의 의견'에 의하여 기존의 모든 review stream과 상반된 내용의 수정을 요구하고, 이 (기존 내용과 상반되는) 신규 reviewer의 의견을 못 반영했다는 이유로 major revision 및 reject을 받은 것은 합리적이지 않은 과정으로 사료됨.\\
또한, 이 과정에서의 신규 리뷰어의 의견이 '기존 모델의 치명적 오류' 등을 언급한 것이 아닌 부분도 고려가 필요.\\
이에 해당 논문을 기존의 리뷰 방향에서 다시 고려해줄 것을 요청함.

-----------------------------------





[최근 3rd round에서 minor revision을 받았던 manuscript가 4th round에서 새로운 리뷰어가 들어오면서 기존 리비전 방향과 맞지 않는 코멘트를 받게됨. SE가 기존 리뷰팀이 아닌 신규 리뷰어의 의견에 힘을 실으면서 결국 5th round에서 reject]

[우리는 다음과 같이 억울한 포인트가 있으므로 minor revision 당시에 대한 revision 결과에 대해 재평가 받아야 한다고 생각함]

1. SE는 3rd round까지의 리뷰팀의 방향을 긍정적으로 보았고, accept에 가까운(실제 letter 멘트 인용 필요) minor revision을 주었음.

1) minor revision -> major로 바뀌는 과정에서 새로운 리뷰어가 들어온것은 괜찮은데 이전 review process에서 지적되지 않았던 새로운 그리고 RQ에 관련한 high-level comment가 제기되어서 이전 reviewer들 요청사항을 반영한 RQ와 scope에 기반한 up-to-date manuscript에 대한 온당한 리뷰가 진행되지 않은 부분

2) 가장 최근 revision process에서 저희가 point-by-point로 response한 부분에 있어서도 reviewer가 충분히 읽고 평가했는지 잘모르겠습니다. 이부분을 reviewer's mistake로 말하기는 참 어렵겠지만, 저희 response와 reviewer feedback을 보면 성실한 의무를 다했다고 볼 수는 없을 것 같고.. 참 그렇네요..

5th round 리뷰 전문:\\
This is an R4 paper. As we indicated in the last round comments, this will be the last revision chance. We will have to decide whether to accept (or conditionally accept) or reject the paper in this round. 

We are grateful for the reviewers who commented on this paper last time to help this time. To my deep regrets, despite seeing some improvement, the critical reviewer who had serious concerns last time still found serious problems in this R4 paper. 

Overall, the reviewer advised that the paper's contribution is still below the needed level for POM and there are problems in areas such as literature positioning (which relates to the novelty of findings) as well as various model settings and considerations. The reviewer hence advised against publication. As the comments are very detailed in the review report, I do not repeat them here. 

Based on the review comments which I concur, I am afraid the paper should be returned. I do sincerely thank the authors for their hard work and kind submission. 


\textbf{6. 이미 3년에 걸친 기간에 세 차례의 리뷰 라운드를 거쳐 minor revision까지 받은 상황에서 새로운 리뷰어의 등장으로 기존 모델의 치명적 오류가 아닌 전혀 다른 이유를 내세워 reject하는 것은 받아들이기에 어려움. 이에 해당 논문을 기존의 리뷰 방향에서 다시 고려해줄 것을 요청함.}

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,
Kun Soo Park

2nd round 리뷰 전문:
I sent the revised paper to the same review team. While they acknowledge and appreciate the effort exerted by the authors, both reviewers continue to have major concerns with the paper. As a result, both reviewers suggest another round of "major revision." I went over the revised paper and the reviewers’ comments, and I concur with the reviewers’ comments. I would like to recommend another “major revision” and give the authors the opportunity to address the concerns. 
 
Given the reviewers’ expertise and the thorough reports they provide, I have little to add. Rather, I would refer the authors to the detailed comments in the reviewers’ reports. Next, I would like to highlight three major concerns. 

\noindent\textbf{Main Concern: Uniqueness of Storage Sharing}\\
As R2 correctly notes, it remains unclear in this revised version what are the unique features of storage sharing (compared with other peer-to-peer platforms) and whether these unique features are captured by the main model. If this study is positioned to focus on storage sharing, the authors may want to elaborate on its distinct features, ensure the model captures some (if not all) of these features, and explain how these distinct features connect with the main results. Of course, the alternative is to position the paper to study peer-to-peer platforms in general. In that case, it will be fine to assume away some specifics of a particular type of platforms. In either way, the authors should be upfront and present clearly about that to readers, and articulate the contribution beyond the existing literature. 
 \noindent\textbf{Main Concern: Model}\\
Both reviewers continue to have concerns with the model setup. 
(a) Heterogeneity of users: As R2 points out, users (both renters and providers) can be heterogeneous in other dimensions as well, which is a good observation. The authors are encouraged to explore possible models which consider heterogeneity in multiple dimensions. However, I would think that the review team will also be fine if the authors can only incorporate some heterogeneity into the model (e.g., the heterogeneity the current model considers). If they take this approach, the authors should elaborate on at least the following two aspects---why the authors consider this specific heterogeneity against other possible heterogeneity, and how the chosen model setup (i.e., ignoring the other possible heterogeneity) affects the main insights.  
(b) Information: R2 raises a question about how an individual provider could learn the information about the expected demand, which requires some clarification. If there is no specific mechanism or channel for providers to learn this information, I wonder if their “rational expectation” works. At any rate, the authors should carefully think about this and clearly explain how providers know the expected demand. 
(c) Probability of Service Failure: R1 correctly notes that is it is not rigorous to claim that “by setting a proper $m$ and $k$, the chance of service failure is very small,” because price is endogenous and it affects the number of active providers. The authors should at least examine whether the desirable m and k will occur in equilibrium (under the equilibrium price). 
\noindent\textbf{Main Concern: Writing}

I agree with R2 that the writing could be further improved. The reviewer generously provides detailed suggestions. I would encourage the authors to follow the suggestions and go even beyond to further polish the paper.

I am very thankful to the two experienced reviewers for providing their valuable comments. I hope the authors can take advantage of their comments and further improve the paper. The authors did a good job clarifying many issues in the first round. I would encourage the authors to address the reviewers’ comments with the same standard. Good luck with the revision. 



cf) fourth round review 메일에는 R1 accept라고 되어있었으나, 그 전 라운드에서 SE가 rejection을 주었던 reviewer가 리뷰가 불가능하다고 하였음. R2는 계속해서 호의적인 리뷰를 주었기에 R2가 accpet을 준 것이지만 SE의 typo로 추정함.

% \noindent \textbf{Reviewer 1 (Point 1): }
% The revised manuscript addressed part of my concerns, while the following two major concerns are still not addressed: 

% 1. About the probability of service failure. The revised paper argues that by setting a proper $m$ and $k$, the chance of service failure is very small. Essentially, this is based on that the required $m$ and $k$ can always be achievable, regardless of price. However, it is not the case since price will certainly affect the number of active providers, which will affect the achievable $m$.   
 
% The fact that the platform penalizes the providers who do not maintain certain uptime does NOT mean that the redundancy level can be achieved since it also largely depends on price, which is the decision to be made. 
 
% All in all, this is still a big missing point and incorrect assumption. 
% }
% \end{quotation}\vspace{-4mm}

% We sincerely thank you for this constructive comment. As you noted, prices affect the number of participating providers and the platform's total storage capacity, but it is not related to \textit{realized} redundancy rates for the following reasons.
% %Therefore, for some pricing schemes and service fees, the storage demand of renters willing to use the service (i.e., $\theta \upsilon_s$) can be higher than the storage supply by participating providers (i.e., $\omega_s$). However, even in such cases, the ratio $m/k$ always holds because renters beyond the capacity are not assigned to individual providers. In other words, the required redundancy is always achieved because the platform cannot serve the excessive storage demand. 
% The platform assigns a designated number of providers and renters for each contract following the redundancy rate of $m/k$. If the platform increases the rate, it needs more providers to serve one renter. However, even in this case, the ratio $m/k$ does not change because any excessive storage demand not assigned to the contract becomes rationed. In other words, the required redundancy is always achieved regardless of $n_r$ and $n_p$. While not affecting the realized redundancy, pricing helps better manage the excessive demand. Specifically, the platform can improve its profit by raising service fees and discouraging renters with a lower willingness to pay. It can increase service fees until participating providers can serve all renters willing to pay for the prices. Again, regardless of how many renters are not served, the redundancy ratio $m/k$ holds due to the provider-renter contract structure.

% Although our model has already reflected this aspect, we admit that the previous manuscript did not sufficiently explain how our model works and what the redundancy constraint means. Therefore, in the revised manuscript, we have added these details as follows:

% ``We consider a profit-seeking platform that gathers renters and providers in the common marketplace and enables encrypted contracts for storage sharing services between them. The P2P storage platform first sets the redundancy rate $\theta$ and the required uptime $t$. For a given $\theta$, the platform can assign renters to providers until the storage demand multiplied by $\theta$ reaches the total storage capacity.'' (page 11)

% ``(...) In this equation, $\min\{\theta \upsilon_s, \omega_s\}$ implies the total volume of shared storage. Specifically, when there are sufficient participating providers, all renters can store their files in the network. Thus, $\theta \upsilon_s$ is identical to the total stored volume. In contrast, when the storage capacity of participating providers is insufficient to meet the demand, the platform can serve storage up to $\omega_s$. In this case, the platform serves the renter's demand until $\omega_s / \theta$, which is the total storage capacity divided by the redundancy ratio.'' (page 14)

% % 1) 어떤 pricing 내에서 실제로 renter가 provider보다 더 많을 수 있음($\theta$고려). 이 경우에는 이 redundancy rates가 achievable하지 않게 보일 수도 있음.\\
% % 2) 그런데 사실 이 경우에도 이 $m/k$는 성립하는 것임. 왜냐하면 그냥 일부 renter가 저장을 못하는 것일 뿐.\\
% % 3) 하지만 이 경우에 기업은 profit을 최대화하는 관점에서는 price를 높임으로써 renter들을 이탈시키고, provider에 대해 더 많은 incentive를 제공하는 형태로 이 renter 및 provider 사이의 interaction을 pricing을 통하여 이용할 수 있음\\
% % 4) 결과적으로 모든 renter가 저장을 하면서 $m/k$도 성립하는 형태로 pricing을 할 수 있게 됌.\\

% % i) failure rate를 만족하는 redundancy rate가 존재하느냐 \\
% % ii) 그러면 위 redundancy rate대로 renter / provider 사이에서 할 수 있느냐\\

% Also, thanks to your comments, we have revisited whether and when our previous solutions of service fees remain optimal under the given algorithm parameters $m$ and $k$. We have revealed that some of our previous solutions are not optimal under substantially low $\xi$ (i.e., operating cost) due to the following reasons. 
% % because the platform needs to crowd out some renters by raising prices to maximize its profit.
% Previously, our solutions did not consider that $n_p$ is the upper limit of the number of participating providers. We have found that when operating costs are not negligible to potential providers, this does not change our results. However, if $\xi$ is very low and then all providers join the platform under our previous solution, we have found that this might alter the optimal service fees in some conditions. Specifically, lower operating costs are more advantageous for providers, but they cannot affect the total capacity when $n_p$ providers have already joined the platform. We have taken account of this constraint in our revised analysis and identified the conditions where the optimal service fees should deviate from our previous solutions to meet the given redundancy level.

% Let us note in advance that these conditions are very unlikely to occur in practice. To be specific, the upper limit $n_p$ matters when operating costs are so small (i.e., small $\xi$) that all potential providers would join the platform under either the current $\xi$. Contrary to such conditions, we have observed that the profitability and operating costs are major concerns in online forums for P2P storage platforms.\footnote{The profitability and operating costs are widely discussed among Storj's official forum (https://forum.storj.io/) and other forum users (e.g., Reddit).} As a result, many potential providers hesitate to offer their storage and bandwidth services. For this reason, we do not consider such cases in our main analysis and separately provide their results as below.

% % \textbf{When are previous solutions not optimal?} 

% % We have identified the conditions where our previous solutions are optimal or not as follows:

% % \textit{Case }1) when $\frac{3}{4}\alpha \le \xi$, our all previous solutions for all pricing schemes are optimal,\\
% % \textit{Case }2) when $\frac{3}{10}\alpha \le \xi < \frac{3}{4}\alpha$, some of our previous solutions for some pricing schemes cannot be optimal,\\
% % \textit{Case }3) when $\xi < \frac{3}{10}\alpha$, all of our previous solutions are not optimal.

% % In sum, our previous solutions are optimal only when $\frac{3}{4}\alph a \le \xi$ (\textit{Case }1). Below, we have discussed the implications of our findings when the previous solutions are not optimal.

% % Note that we can generalize this condition as $\frac{2b-1}{2b}\alpha \le \xi$ for all $b$. We have provided the proof of these cases in the Appendix of this response letter.

% \textbf{What are the outcomes where the previous solutions are not optimal?} We have found that our previous solutions are optimal only when $\frac{3}{4}\alpha \le \xi$. Below, we have discussed the implications of our findings when the previous solutions are not optimal.

% We conduct a numerical analysis 
% % for \textit{Case }2 and d \textit{Case }3,
% for extremely low $\xi$, where our previous solutions may not optimize the profits of some pricing scheme. We have found that as $\xi$ decreases (i.e., operating costs decrease), the two-part tariff and the hybrid pricing can be less effective in boosting the total surplus than the subscription-based pricing for the following reasons.

% Since providers do not respond to bandwidth fees sensitively under small $\xi$, raising prices does not help renters find more capacity while it increases their financial burden. Therefore, the two-part tariff, which compensates for providers' bandwidth services, becomes less effective in boosting system surplus than the subscription-based pricing. Consequently, the surplus implication of pricing schemes is similar to the first-best prices under substantially small $\xi$. The small $\xi$ affects the surplus implication of the hybrid pricing similarly, as shown in our numerical analysis (\textbf{Figure R1-1}). The graph presents the relative system surplus of the two-part tariff and hybrid pricing under $\xi = 0.2$, $\theta=3$, $b=2$, $\lambda_0=1$, $q=2$, and $\alpha=0.95$, where $\xi$ is sufficiently smaller than $\frac{3}{4}\alpha$. The results demonstrate that the subscription-based pricing outperforms these schemes in any small $\xi$ in this case.

% % When $\xi$ is substantially small (i.e., low operating costs), all potential providers are willing to share their storage and participate in the platform. In this situation, the platform can improve its profit by adjusting prices until the participating providers' capacity meets the storage demand, indicating that the current prices are not optimal.

% \caption{Surplus Comparison for Extremely Low Operating Costs}
% \end{figure}

% In the revised manuscript, we have discussed this issue as follows:

% ``First, our model excludes the case where operating costs are negligible for potential providers; that is, we assume that $\xi > \frac{3}{4} \alpha$. Although online forums for P2P storage platforms have been significantly concerned the profitability and operating costs, it is still insightful to understand the consequences of pricing schemes when operating costs become negligible. In Appendix C, we provide technical details of a numerical study examining how small operating costs (i.e., $\xi \le \frac{3}{4} \alpha$) can affect our results. Below, we summarize key insights from this analysis.

% When $\xi$ is substantially small (i.e., low operating costs), all potential providers are willing to share their storage and participate in the platform. Since providers do not respond to bandwidth fees sensitively under small $\xi$, raising prices does not help renters find more capacity while it increases their financial burden. Therefore, the two-part tariff and the hybrid pricing, which compensate for providers' bandwidth services, are less effective in boosting system surplus than the subscription-based pricing. Consequently, the surplus implication of pricing schemes is similar to the first-best prices under substantially small $\xi$.'' (pages 24-25)

% }
% \end{quotation}\vspace{-4mm}

% As you noted, the actual redundancy level in practice is likely to be endogenous. Below, we describe why this happens and suggest the corresponding remedies we have performed in this revision.

% \textbf{Limited size of potential providers.} First, our previous solutions may not be optimal due to the limited size of potential providers. Our response to your \textbf{Point 1} provides an adequate answer on this aspect because the effects of both $m$ and $k$ are integrated into $\theta$ and $\xi$.

% Let us remind how the redundancy algorithm works in P2P storage platforms. Under a $k$-of-$m$ erasure coding scheme, a P2P storage platform divides a renter's original file into $k$ shards and re-codes them into $m$ encrypted fragments ($m > k$). These parameters affect the platform and providers through determining 1) the failure probability, 2) the redundancy rate, and 3) the operating cost.

% The failure probability is calculated as: 
% \begin{equation*}
% \begin{aligned}
% F(t; m, k) = \sum_{j=0}^{k-1} {m \choose j}t^j (1-t)^{m-j}
% \end{aligned}
% \end{equation*}
% where $t$ is the required uptime. To meet the certain level of failure probability, the platform needs to set an appropriate combination of $t$, $m$, and $k$. The set $m$ and $k$ determine the redundancy rate as $\theta=m/k$, and the set $t$ determines the unit operating cost for a provider, $\xi(t)$. In this way, $\theta$ and $\xi$ capture how $(m, k)$ combination affects the provider's decision. 

% \textbf{Endogenous decisions on redundancy algorithm.} Second, and importantly, the platform can make decisions on the redundancy algorithm to maximize its profit. Correspondingly, we have considered such decisions and revised the sequence of events as shown in \textbf{Figure R1-2}. Here, the platform first decides its redundancy algorithm. Then, the market size of peers (i.e., $n_r$ and $n_p$) is realized. In response to this market, the platform decides its service fees $(p_s, p_b)$. This is consistent with the current market situation, where the development of a redundancy algorithm takes several months or years.\footnote{Sia and Storj have not officially changed their algorithms since their releases. Also, Sia has not adopted the 64-of-96 algorithm, which this platform announced its development plan in 2020. The announcement is available at https://blog.sia.tech/cloud-storage-for-2-tb-mo-8a34043e93bb.}

% \begin{figure}[ht!]
% \def\figurename{Figure R1 -}
% \centering
% \includegraphics[width=16cm]{fig1_timeline_revised.pdf} 
% \caption{The Sequence of Events}
% \end{figure}

% In the revised version, we have incorporated endogenous decisions on the algorithm, which were provided as a separate theorem (previously \textbf{Theorem 3}), into our main analysis (now \textbf{Theorem 1}). We have shown that the platform determines its redundancy algorithm indifferently across pricing schemes as shown in the theorem below:

% \textbf{Theorem 1.} \textit{For all pricing schemes, the profit-maximizing redundancy algorithm minimizes the total providers' operating costs in the platform; that is, $\arg\max_{\theta, t} \Pi(p_s^o, p_b^o) = \arg\min_{\theta, t} \xi \theta$.}

% This theorem demonstrates that the platform always sets the algorithm that minimizes the total operating costs of providers. The total costs are proportional to $\xi \theta$, where $\xi$ is an increasing function of uptime $t$. A lowered operating cost implies that the P2P storage network is more efficient and attractive to potential providers, which leads to a larger number of participating providers. Namely, a lower $\xi \theta$ enables the platform to serve the same number of renters with fewer potential providers and achieve the first-best prices in line with Lemma 3, which characterizes the threshold $n_p$ for the first-best price. Hence, the platform is always better off by reducing the operating cost.

% Moreover, we show that the optimal ($\theta$, $t$) is identical across the pricing schemes. This result is intuitive considering that lowering operating costs helps every stakeholder, and more importantly, $\xi \theta$ is not a function of service fees, storage capacity, or usage levels. Based on these findings, we can directly use our insights on optimal service fees (Lemmas 2 and 3) to compare these pricing schemes.

% %The study examines pricing schemes of a peer-to-peer (P2P) storage sharing platform, which is a two-sided marketplace of renters with various storage and bandwidth needs and providers with available storage capacity. The pricing scheme considered is a two-part tariff: a storage fee that is dependent of the volume of the files and a bandwidth fee that is dependent of the access rate.
% %Renters decide whether to adopt the P2P platform, while providers determine the uptime that influences the service level. Based on a model that captures the renters’ and providers’ utilities, the optimal pricing parameters are derived under different objectives of the platform: profit-seeking, consumer-welfare maximizing, and a mixed objective that combines both.

% \noindent \textbf{Reviewer 2: }
% In this revised manuscript, the most notable changes, as compared to the previous manuscript, are as follows. (1) The contribution of this paper is re-positioned as investigation of the impacts of different pricing schemes (subscription-based, two-part tariff, and hybrid). (2) The objective of the platform is changed to maximize its expected profit, and the impacts of the platform’s optimal pricing decisions on the total social surplus are examined. (3) Heterogeneity (renters’ willingnessto-pay and providers’ operating costs) is incorporated. (4) The motivation examples are enhanced. As can be seen, the authors have put substantial efforts to address the review team’s concerns raised in the last round, and, as a result, this paper has been completely revamped. I would like to thank them for their sincere efforts. On the positive side, I think the introduction section has been tightened with better explanations for the two motivation examples. Moreover, the potential contribution of this paper is clearer with the focus on comparing the impacts of the three common pricing schemes. Last, I think the results about the ranking of the performance of those pricing schemes based on different performance measure (platform’s profit vs total social surplus) and different supply-demand conditions (sufficient vs insufficient supply) are interesting. Since the paper has been improved in those areas mentioned above, it has good potential to get published. Having said that, I feel that there are some significant questions or concerns about the revised model and there is still plenty of room for improvement in the writing. Hence, I think the paper still needs to be strengthened and polished. My recommendation is Major Revision, hoping that the authors would clear those concerns in a satisfactory fashion (as they did in the last round) such that we can see a clearer path for acceptance.

% 1. The most distinct model features of storage sharing in cloud as compared to other P2P platforms are still not very clear or highlighted enough. First, one may argue that the pricing schemes under consideration as well as the heterogeneity of renters’ (buyers’) willingness to pay and providers’ (suppliers’) operating costs are also common features of other P2P platforms. Second, according to the authors’ response letter, it sounds like the redundancy algorithm is the distinct feature. But on the other hand, the study of the redundancy algorithm is only an extension to check the robustness of the model; in other words, the main results are somewhat independent of the redundancy algorithm, so it can be assumed as exogenously given. The authors should summarize the distinct model features specific to the storage sharing in cloud business model and emphasize them more.}
% \end{quotation}\vspace{-4mm}

% This is a valid point. As you noted, pricing schemes and renter/provider (buyer/supplier) heterogeneity are common features of P2P platforms. Also, our previous model accounts for the algorithm decision only in its extension part. 
% In this revision, we have strengthened our main model and its description to emphasize how distinct our setup is from other P2P contexts. First, we have relaxed the main model's assumption that the redundancy algorithm is exogenously given. We have incorporated this decision and let the platform choose the algorithm $(\theta, t)$ to maximize its expected profit.

% \textbf{Theorem 1} in the new version shows that the platform always decides to set the algorithm to minimize the total operating costs of providers. The total costs are proportional to $\xi \theta$, where $\xi$ is an increasing function of uptime $t$. A lowered operating cost implies that the P2P storage network is more efficient and attractive to potential providers, which leads to a larger number of participating providers. This, in turn, enables the platform to serve more renters. Hence, the platform is always better off by reducing the operating cost.

% Notably, we have shown that the optimal ($\theta$, $t$) is identical across the pricing schemes. This result is intuitive considering that lowering operating costs helps every stakeholder, and importantly, $\xi \theta$ is not a function of service fees, storage capacity, or usage levels. Thus, our main insights from the previous model still hold after accounting for this decision.

% We have reorganized the sections and theorems to reflect such changes, and please refer to \textbf{General Response Table 1}.

% Second, we have further elaborated on how our provider's cost structure differs from other P2P contexts. Specifically, our model allows providers' operating costs to be affected by renters' usage levels, contrary to typical model settings in the sharing economy literature. This enables us to better reflect providers' operational burden and corresponding in-out decisions. We have discussed this point in the last paragraph of the literature review as follows:

% ``Also, unlike Cachon et al. (2017), we allow providers to have heterogeneous operating costs, which are also affected by renters' usage levels. Specifically, we postulate that individual providers have different sensitivities to their uptime level and a higher usage level of a renter leads to a higher operating cost of a provider, which is not the typical model setting in the sharing economy literature. By incorporating this cost structure, we can examine the impact of providers' in-out decisions and the operational burden of bandwidth services.'' (page 7)

% \noindent \textbf {Reviewer 2 (Point A2a): }2. The assumptions that a renter needs a storage space for her unit volume of files and that the provider can share his unit volume of storage space need a second thought. 

% a. As can be seen, the model focuses on the heterogeneity of renters’ bandwidth usage level only, while the heterogeneity of their storage volume is absent due to the assumption of unit volume per renter. This assumption takes away an important tradeoff from the model. In reality, there are renters with large storage volume and low frequency of download request versus renters with small storage volume and  high frequency download request. The specific pricing scheme must have different impacts on renters with different storage and bandwidth needs, thus affecting the segmentation of renters. In short, I wonder whether the authors could build their model based on heterogeneity of not only bandwidth usage but also storage volume.
% }
% \end{quotation}\vspace{-4mm}
 
% We take your point, and we agree in retrospect that the implications of pricing schemes might be different across renter segments depending on their storage and bandwidth needs. Although we could not reflect this heterogeneity in our main model in addition to the three existing dimensions---renters' utility per bandwidth volume, bandwidth request frequency, and providers' operating costs, we have numerically examined the cases where different segments of renters in terms of storage volume and download requests coexist in the market. Our findings obtained from numerical analyses suggest that the main insights from the basic setup remain unchanged. Below, we have summarized their conditions and results.

% %Let us summarize key findings from our additional analyses. We have found that the main insights from the basic setup remain unchanged. Interestingly, depending on how the platform designs hybrid pricing, the influence of hybrid pricing can become similar to that of a two-part tariff because a larger portion of renters demands more bandwidth volume than the bandwidth allowance. We have obtained these findings based on numerical analyses and summarized their conditions and results below.

% \textbf{Generalized utility function.} % (우리가 main model에서는 unit volume인 renter들의 utility function만을 다루었기에) renter의 heterogeneity를 반영하기 위해서는 먼저 unit volume이 아닌 renter들의 utility function의 define 이 필요하다. 이를 define하기 위해서 용량이 v_i이고 frequency가 \lambda_i인 renter를 가정해보자. 우리는 이들의 utility function을 define하는 관점에서 1) net utility가 volume에 비례한다고 가정을 하였다. 2) 저장 비용은 당연히 volume에 비례한다. 3) bandwidth volume은 frequency가 \lambda_i이고 용량이 1인 renter의 v_i배가 된다.
% Since the utility functions in our main model concern renters with a unit storage volume only, we need to define new utility functions for renters with heterogeneous storage volume. To do this, we have considered renter $i$ having storage volume $v_i$ and frequency $\lambda_i$. For this renter's utility function, we have assumed that 1) the benefit from P2P storage is proportional to $\lambda_i v_i$, 2) the storage cost is proportional to $v_i$, and 3) the bandwidth volume is $v_i$ times of the unit-volume renter with $\lambda_i$.

% % 따라서 bandwidth fee가 없는 subscription이나 비례해서 부과하는 two-part tariff의 경우에는 전체 utility function 자체가 용량이 1인 경우의 v_i배가 된다고 할 수 있다. 하지만 hybrid pricing의 경우에서는 무료 용량이 어떻게 제공되는지에 따라서 utility function도 달라질 수 있다.
% Based on these assumptions, we have seen that for the two-part tariff and subscription-based pricing, the new utility function is $v_i$ times of the previous function for a unit storage volume. However, the hybrid pricing might have various utility forms regarding how to price bandwidth services. For instance, the platform may offer the volume of bandwidth allowance proportionally to storage volume, which is widely observed in cloud service contracts. Also, the platform may provide the volume constantly across all renters regardless of their storage volume.

% Since these possibilities seem plausible, we have examined both cases to explore the implications of hybrid pricing in the new setting. Below, we have specified the renter's utility functions in the current model and the extended ones that account for volume heterogeneity.

% Here are the current utility functions of renters by pricing scheme:
% \begin{equation*}
%     U_i = \begin{cases}
%     \lambda_i u_i - \theta p_s &\text{ under the subscription-based pricing,}\\
%     \lambda_i u_i - \theta p_s - \max\{\lambda_i - q \lambda_0, 0\}p_b &\text{ under the hybrid pricing,}\\
%     \lambda_i u_i - \theta p_s - \lambda_i p_b &\text{ under the two-part tariff.}
%     \end{cases}
% \end{equation*}
% Henceforth, we generalize those functions for renter $i$'s storage volume $v_i$. First, when the bandwidth allowance is proportional to $v_i$, we can rewrite the functions as follows (\textbf{Utility Function I}):
% \begin{equation*}
%     U_i = \begin{cases}
%     \lambda_i u_i v_i- \theta v_i p_s &\text{ under the subscription-based pricing,}\\
%     \lambda_i u_i v_i- \theta v_i p_s - \max\{\lambda_i v_i - q \lambda_0 v_i, 0\}p_b &\text{ under the hybrid pricing,}\\
%     \lambda_i u_i v_i- \theta v_i p_s - \lambda_i v_i p_b &\text{ under the two-part tariff.}
%     \end{cases}
% \end{equation*}
% If $\lambda_0$ is independent of $v_i$, the utility is proportional to $v_i$ for all pricing schemes. Therefore, mere differences in storage demand do not affect a renter's adoption decision in this situation.

% Second, we can rewrite the utility functions when the bandwidth allowance is constant as follows (\textbf{Utility Function II}): 
% \begin{equation*}
%     U_i = \begin{cases}
%     \lambda_i u_i v_i- \theta v_i p_s &\text{ subscription}\\
%     \lambda_i u_i v_i- \theta v_i p_s - \max\{\lambda_i v_i- q \lambda_0, 0\}p_b &\text{ hybrid}\\
%     \lambda_i u_i v_i- \theta v_i p_s - \lambda_i v_i p_b &\text{ two-part tariff}
%     \end{cases}
% \end{equation*}
% The notable difference is that the cost for bandwidth service in the hybrid pricing is not proportional to $v_i$. Specifically, the bandwidth fees are more burdensome for renters with high $v_i$ than those with low $v_i$. Noe that this situation is equivalent to having $v_i$ renters with a unit storage volume receives the free bandwidth allowance of $q\lambda_0 / v_i$. Therefore, the renter's decision can vary due to the storage demand.

% \textbf{Renter heterogeneity.} 
% % 우리는 volume에 따라 달라질 수 있는 두 가지의 utility function을 고려하여  용량이랑 frequency가 independent하고, 용량에만 heterogeneity가 있는 경우와 + 용량이랑 frequency 사이에 coorelation도 있는 경우에 대하여 numerical study를 시행하였다. 
% %이 numerical test를 위하여 우리는 We have considered two segments of renters: 1) low-storage renters with storage volume $v_l = 1$, and 2) high-storage renters with storage volume $v_h = 10 $으로 setting 하였다. 그리고, 첫번쨰로는 이 용량이 frequency와 관련 없는 경우를 고려하기 위하여, $b_l = b_h = 2$로 setting하였다. 두번째로는 이 용량이 frequency와 negative correlation이 있는 경우를 고려하였다. 용량이 큰 고객들의 평균 사용량이 적음을 반영하기 위하여 용량이 큰 집단(v_h)에 대해서는 pareto distribution에서의 shape parameter인 b=5로 가정하였다. 
% Considering the two types of possible utility functions, we have conducted numerical studies on two renter-heterogeneity scenarios. First, we have examined the scenario where low-storage renters with storage volume ($v_l = 1$) and high-storage renters with storage volume ($v_h = 10$) have the same frequency distribution. We have set the parameters of Pareto distributions as $b_l = b_h = 2$ \textit{(\underline{Scenario i})}. Second, we have postulated that low-storage renters with storage volume ($v_l = 1$) and high-storage renters with storage volume ($v_h = 10$) have different frequency distributions. To make low-storage renters tend to request downloads more frequently than high-storage renters, we have chosen $b_l = 2$ and $b_h = 5$ for their Pareto distributions \textit{(\underline{Scenario ii})}.

% % 또한, 이 renter의 volume heterogeneity가 끼칠 수 있는 다양한 경우들을 고려하기 위하여, low volume : high volume의 비율이 9:1, 5:5, 1:9인 세 가지 경우에 대하여 conduct하였다. 결과적으로 모든 상황에서 우리의 결과가 preserve되었다. 각각에 graph는 아래를 봐라.
% To account for potential impacts of the renter composition, we have varied the proportions of low- and high-storage renters (9:1, 5:5, and 1:9) for each scenario. We have selected $q=3$ for our analysis. The results show that our findings remain consistent in all of the utility functions and scenarios (see \textbf{Figures R2-1 through R2-4}); that is, the total surplus of the two-part tariff (red lines) and that of the hybrid pricing (blue lines) can be higher/lower than the subscription-based pricing (normalized as 1, presented by the black horizontal line) when the number of potential providers is small/large.

% % $q=3$으로 삼은 이유는 $v_h = 10$인 고객들이 $q = 0.3$이 되어서, two-part tariff와 같은 형태가 되게 만들기 위해($v$가 큰 고객들로 인하여 형태가 달라지는 것을 반영하기 위하여)

% b. Compared to the concern on the unit volume of each renter, perhaps the assumption that each provider supplies unit volume of unused capacity is fine. But the implication is that the provider’s income and cost are both proportional to the volume of capacity supplied. If this is most likely the case in the storage sharing industry, the authors need to explain this point to justify this assumption; otherwise, I wonder whether the authors could relax this assumption, i.e., whether the impacts of a specific pricing scheme on providers with different capacity are different.}
% \end{quotation}\vspace{-4mm}

% This is another great point. As you indicated, we can safely ensure the validity of our findings if each provider's income and cost are both proportional to his storage capacity. Specifically, we set each provider's operating cost to be proportional to $\hat{\omega_b}$ (i.e., the expected bandwidth volume for each provider), and $\hat{\omega_b}$ is proportional to each provider's shared storage capacity. Below, we discuss whether this assumption is consistent with the reality, and potential implications of alternative cost forms.

% \textbf{Is the operating cost proportional to $\hat{\omega_b}$?} The operating costs may include various sources, such as Internet bandwidth, electricity costs, and obsolescence of the computing device. Intuitively, bandwidth and electricity costs are proportional to bandwidth usage. Hardware obsolescence is directly related to the computational burden, and it is attributable to both computation amount and running time. Although the exact functional form of this relationship is unknown, its impact tends to be secondary to other direct costs (i.e., bandwidth and electricity) and is partially absorbed by $\xi(t)$. Thus, it is plausible to assume that the operating cost is proportional to $\hat{\omega_b}$.

% \textbf{Is $\hat{\omega_b}$ proportional to the provider's capacity?} P2P storage platforms usually encourage providers to share more capacity by mentioning that sharing more capacity will lead to more access from renters and more earnings. Also, it is commonly observed that providers with higher capacity tend to store more files than those with lower capacity on these platforms. Thus, it is plausible to assume that the platform assigns more files and bandwidth services to high-capacity providers than low-capacity ones.

% \textbf{How would alternative cost forms affect the results?} Alternative cost functions may affect our main insights as follows. First, we may consider a convex function, such as quadratic and exponential forms, where operating costs are particularly burdensome for high-capacity providers. In this case, as high-capacity providers bear much higher operating costs and join the platform less, the first-best prices will be less achievable. Hence, compensating for offering bandwidth services will have a higher impact on the storage capacity. Consequently, the relative benefits of two-part tariff and hybrid pricing (vs. subscription-based pricing), which mainly come from enhancing the platform's capacity, will be greater in this situation.

% Second, we may also consider a concave function of operating costs like a square root function. Since high-capacity providers bear relatively less operating burden than they do in the current setup, the platform will attract more providers under the subscription-based pricing---which does not compensate for offering bandwidth services. Therefore, the profit/surplus gap between the subscription and other pricing schemes will decrease as a result. However, although the magnitudes decline, we expect the differences to remain qualitatively unchanged.

% We have summarized this discussion in the revised manuscript as follows:

% ``Second, one might consider an alternative form of the provider's operating cost. Basically, the current form relies on the assumptions that operating costs are proportional to $\hat{\omega_b}$ (i.e., the expected bandwidth volume for each provider), and that $\hat{\omega_b}$ is proportional to each provider's shared storage capacity. We argue that these assumptions are plausible for the following reasons: 1) many of the major costs, such as Internet bandwidth and electricity costs, are proportional to bandwidth usage, and 2) the platform tends to assign more files and bandwidth services to high-capacity providers than low-capacity ones.

% So, how would alternative cost forms affect the results? On the one hand, we may consider a convex function, such as quadratic and exponential forms, where operating costs are particularly burdensome for high-capacity providers. In this case, as high-capacity providers bear much higher operating costs and join the platform less, compensating for offering bandwidth services will have a higher impact on the storage capacity. Consequently, the relative benefits of two-part tariff and hybrid pricing (vs. subscription-based pricing) will be greater in this situation. On the other hand, we may also consider a concave function like a square root function. Since high-capacity providers bear relatively less operating burden than they do in the current setup, the platform will attract more providers under the subscription-based pricing. Hence, the profit/surplus gap between the subscription and other pricing schemes will decrease as a result. However, although the magnitudes decline, we expect the differences to remain qualitatively unchanged.'' (page 25)

The assumption about independence of a renter’s utility from the download bandwidth service from her download frequency is questionable. One may argue that the two parameters are positively correlated as the more frequent the renter needs to access the storage, the more valuable the bandwidth service means to her.}
% \end{quotation}\vspace{-4mm}

% This is another great point. In our analysis, we have postulated that a renter's utility per bandwidth volume is independent of her download frequency. Let us note that among renters adopting the platform, the utility per volume and the download frequency are already positively associated with each other as a result of self-selection. In this regard, if the two parameters are positively correlated among all potential renters, we will obtain a more dramatic relationship among platform-adopting renters. Therefore, we expect that the implications of pricing schemes will be qualitatively consistent.

% We have validated this conjecture by examining a scenario where potential renters with the higher utility per download volume tend to have more frequent download requests. We have manipulated the shape parameter $b$ of the Pareto distribution---which determines the extent to which the bandwidth frequency is concentrated or dispersed---differently by the utility per bandwidth volume. Specifically, we have divided potential renters into two groups: 1) renters whose unit utility is uniformly distributed in $[0, 0.5]$ and whose frequency follows the Pareto distribution having a lighter tail (with $b_l=5$), and 2) those whose unit utility is uniformly distributed in $[0.5, 1]$ and whose frequency follows the Pareto distribution having a heavier tail (with $b_h=2$), where $b_l > b_h$. For this scenario, we have conducted a numerical analysis and obtained qualitatively similar results (see \textbf{Figure R2-5}).

Moreover, we have provided additional examples showing that digital consumption is likely to have heavy-tailed distributions. The following presents our revised paragraph:

% ``This model concerns renters with a continuum of bandwidth usage level (or frequency of download requests) of stored files denoted by $\lambda$. It has been empirically observed in the literature that the usage of cloud-resource is distributed with relatively heavy tails compared with exponential, log-normal, and normal distributions (Loboz, 2012), similarly to other digital resources like smartphone and YouTube usage (Falaki et al., 2010; Gill et al., 2008).

The reader may wonder how to derive the expected storage and bandwidth volume for each provider ($\hat{\omega}_s, \hat{\omega}_b$, and $\hat{\omega}_{bp}$), while it turns out that the derivations will be introduced later in section 4. Moreover, to facilitate the reader’s understanding of the formulation, it would be better to explain why $\hat{\omega}_b = \hat{\omega}_s \cdot \nu_b / (\theta \nu_s)$ holds (i.e., the meaning of the ratio $\nu_b / (\theta \nu_s) $is not immediately clear to the reader). }

% Thank you for these constructive comments on describing our model setup. First, we agree that the necessary information needed to understand the provider's decision in Section 3.2---the notations for the expected storage and bandwidth volume, shaped by renters' aggregate decisions---appeared too late in the last version. To address this point, we have moved the renter's decisions and relevant notations from Section 4 to the beginning of Section 3.2. We believe that this restructuring will substantially help improve the readability of our paper.

% Second, we have further elaborated the meaning of $\hat{\omega}_b = \hat{\omega}_s \cdot \nu_b / (\theta \nu_s)$, which was used to describe the provider's profit function $\pi_j =\alpha (\hat{\omega}_s p_s + \hat{\omega}_{bp} p_b) - \rho_j \hat{\omega}_b \xi$. In the new version, we have revised this equation to better present that the platform randomly assigns storage demand to participating providers. 

% Specifically, we have replaced the equation from
% \begin{equation*}
% 	\hat{\omega}_b = \hat{\omega}_s \cdot \frac{\upsilon_b}{\theta \upsilon_s} 
% \end{equation*}
% to
% \begin{equation*}
% 	\hat \omega_b = \frac{\hat \omega_s}{\theta \upsilon_s} \cdot \upsilon_b.
% \end{equation*}
% Here, $\hat \omega_s$ is the individual provider's expected storage volume, and $\theta \upsilon_s$ indicates the total storage demand multiplied by the redundancy rate in the network. Therefore, $\hat \omega_s / (\theta \upsilon_s)$ implies that the platform assigns bandwidth volume to each provider proportionally to his share from the entire stored volume. In other words, each provider obtains a smaller portion of the storage and bandwidth volumes as more providers join the platform.

% \end{quotation}\vspace{-4mm}

% In the new version, we have provided the platform's optimization problem in Section 4. In the equation $V_{bp} = V_s \cdot \nu_{bp} / (\theta \nu_s)$ of this problem, $V_s = \min\{\theta \upsilon_s, \omega_s\}$ is the total volume of shared storage, and $V_s / (\theta \nu_s)$ means the share of stored data from the total storage demand. We have added this interpretation and explained why we can reduce this constraint into $\theta \upsilon_s \le \omega_s$ as follows:

% ``Here, $V_s$ is the total volume of shared storage and $V_s / (\theta \upsilon_s)$ means the share of stored data from the total storage demand. When there are sufficient participating providers, $V_s = \theta \upsilon_s$ and $V_{bp} = \upsilon_{bp}$. Otherwise, $V_s = \omega_s$ and $V_{bp} = (\omega_s / \theta \upsilon_s) \cdot \upsilon_{bp} < \upsilon_{bp}$, indicating that the total paid bandwidth volume is smaller than the bandwidth demand.

% Importantly, in the second scenario (i.e., $V_s = \omega_s$), the platform can always increase its profit by raising service fees. This is because the platform can attract a larger number of providers and serve more storage volume. For this reason, we can reduce this platform's problem into the equivalent problem as follows:'' (page 16)

On a related note, in the formulation of the providers’ total surplus PS (at the end of page 20), it seems that the authors assume $\rho_j$ is uniformly distributed over $[0,1]$, but I didn’t find the statement of this assumption (or perhaps I just missed it).}
% \end{quotation}\vspace{-4mm}

% Thank you for this comment. Yes, $\rho_j$ is uniformly distributed over $[0,1]$ as you noted. After reviewing our previous manuscript, we have found that our explanation of this assumption was difficult for readers to notice. Therefore, we have revised Section 3.1 to make this assumption more salient. In addition, we have restated this when we have mentioned that $\rho_j$ is heterogeneous in Section 3.2.2.

For example, on top of page 7, the discussion is about “this study also extends the literature on sharing platforms for computing resources,” then, on the same page, the discussion continues to be about “emerging platforms have enabled sharing various computing resources.” But, later on page 8, again the discussion goes back to “this study also contributes to the literature on the pricing for resource sharing services.” The writing of these paragraphs feels like on an ad hoc basis. Maybe a better sequence is as follows: (1) pricing (and capacity management) in centralized public cloud; (2) P2P sharing of computing resources; (3) literature on other forms of sharing economies. Finally, in the last paragraph, summarize the distinct model features and contribution to the existing literature.}
